# YanSimSaveFilemngr
A basic Yandere Simulator Save File manager.

Requirements : .net 4.0

# how to use (IMPORTANT):
  this tool modified the registry where yandere simulator stores its data
  to use this you cant use this on the first day as on the first day the values
  are always reseted to their default ones
  so youre gonna have to save on tuesday and then close the game and then modify the values
  and then you should be good to go

  or you can also try to modify the values on a loading screen before the game loads 
  
  (i didnt test that but it could work)

tested with the jan 13th 2024 build
